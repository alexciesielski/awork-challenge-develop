Intro
Thank you for your interest and for taking part in our challenge! We‚Äôre already curious and really looking forward to your results. ü§©
We love communication, so please if you have any questions, that may appear along the way or you need help/guidance, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask us.
The target time for this challenge is 2-4 hours but you are not limited by it. Please use your time wisely and let us know how long you took for it and why.
We want to see how you work and how you approach the challenge. Bear in mind that your code is going to be read and reviewed by others.
There are several ‚Äúbonus points‚Äù. These are optional, but we will be very happy if we see any of those in your solution üëÄ.

Goal
üëâüèº Given an initial application which consumes a public Users API and displays them in a list, implement all the requirements detailed below. The main goal of this challenge is to improve the performance and add missing featuresto the existing application.

API documentation: https://randomuser.me/

Requirements
The application should:

- Show a list of users grouped by a specific category.
  - The grouping of the array of Users should be done via a Web Worker.
  - Criteria can be chosen: alphabetically, age, nationality, etc.
  - [Bonus Point] Add a button which switches the grouping between multiple categories.
- Groups should look nice in the UI

  - CHECK BELOW: Idea of result (Don‚Äôt limit yourself to this idea, make it look awesome!).

- Show 5000 Users on the page with good load and runtime performance without using pagination (even in mobile devices).
  - Improve components performance.
  - The page should load fast.
  - The page should be interactive fast.
  - No performance degradation when interacting with the page.
  - Optimize device resources usage: CPU, memory.
- When clicking on a User from the list, the item should expand inside the same list with a cool animation and show extra information the API provides in a nice and clear way.
  - Feel free to choose the information you display.
- Improve the overall UI/UX of the app until you are proud of it. The code provided already has some basic styles which are coming from our original awork app, but it still deserves some love.
  - Make it look awesome by, for example, adding a header for the list columns, an improved loading state, etc.
  - Here you can be creative about it, the sky is the limit!
- Write a documentation on how you approached the problem and what the solution consists of.
- [Bonus Point] Search users without using API.
- [Bonus Point] Add pagination using the page size of 5000 items
  - The API documentation has the information on how to do this.

Deliverables

1. Source Code: Use git and share a repository via GitHub with sebastianrosch, marcelotedeschi and santiagof4 .
2. Feature Documentation: A summary of the solution and argumentation for the decisions made. You can choose which format you use (PDF, Notion, Slack Message, etc.)
3. Readme: add a Readme with instructions on how to setup and run the application as well as any information you judge important for a Readme document.
4. [Bonus point]: Run the full application on a cloud solution for previewing live via a link

Evaluation Criteria
The implementation should follow the important aspects of a production ready application. Please give special attention to:

1. Code quality, maintainability and testability
2. Project and components structure
3. Good practices
4. Proper usage of the JS framework and language
5. Correctness and Completeness: Proper implementation of the required functionality.
6. Collaboration Aspect: your project should be setup the best way possible to ensure good collaboration between many developers
